Local repo testing
Lot of branching testing now. Want to try to find out if I can make a branch point to somewhere consistently.

I'm still curious to check out linking bugs.

This is also my first edit of the readme.

I'm adding text that's different over here to see what happens.

I think I understand forking, but I'd like to try it out to be sure

How do I get this branch back?
